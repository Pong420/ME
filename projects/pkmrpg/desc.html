I like playing video game, I like <span>Pokemon</span> and I learned program. Then my first self-project ---
<span>Pokemon RPG</span> started. As a beginner, it is impossible to clone a <span>Pokemon</span> game to a web game. So my
purpose is creating a challenge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4xL2kEN9Yk">Defeats champion Red with Lv5 pokemon</a>. Finally, I give up the
project as not enough resource and the mechanism of battle is too complex for me.
