I enjoy playing video games, particularly <span>Pokemon</span>, and have even learned programming. This led me to embark on my first self-project, which was creating a <span>Pokemon RPG</span>. As a novice programmer, I quickly realized that replicating a <span>Pokemon</span> game into a web game was a daunting task.

Consequently, I opted to create a unique challenge for myself, which involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4xL2kEN9Yk">Defeats champion Red with Lv5 pokemon</a>.

However, I ultimately abandoned the project due to insufficient resources and the game's complex battle mechanisms that exceeded my current programming skills.
